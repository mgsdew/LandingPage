1. At first run backup or SQL file from 'DB' folder for creation of Database of this project.
   I used SQL Server 2017 as Database for this project.

2. After creation of Datbase please change your Server name & credentials from Web.Config file
  inside the project

3. I used Entity Framework 6.4.4 (latest version) as ORM so, if refernece not found during building 
   project then please add it from Nuget.
